There are many resources we leverage for this: the developer survey answers, GitHub issue upvotes, Algolia search volume, Google search volume, documentation usage, npm downloads, etc.\n  - Prioritize the creation of frequently needed components.\n  - Encourage the usage of third-party components if they already exist and are well maintained.\n- **Design.** \ud83c\udf80 We are relatively up-to-date but the Material Design specification [is evolving](https://material.io/whats-new/), so should we. We also plan to implement [a second design](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/22485).\n- **Better customization.** \ud83d\udc85 We want to make our component customization intuitive, no matter if you are using global CSS or styled-components:\n- **Better documentation.** \ud83d\udcda No problem is solved until documented.\n- **Performance.** \ud83d\ude80 React abstraction has a cost. The more components you render, the slower your page will be. You will notice stark differences when rendering a large table or list.\n- **Bundle size.** \ud83d\udce6 You can follow our progress [with bundlephobia.com report](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@material-ui/core). Please pay special attention to the cost of the individual modules under \"Exports Analysis\".\n- **TypeScript.** \ud83d\udccf We are continuously improving the definitions. The codebase is mostly written in JavaScript with manually authored `.d.ts` definitions. While we don't plan a migration effort as as standlone effort, new modules are written in TypeScript.\n- **Accessibility.** \u267f\ufe0f We have relatively [few accessibility issues](https://darekkay.com/blog/accessible-ui-frameworks/), but we are eager to address them all. We would appreciate the help of accessibility experts.\n\n## Quarterly roadmap\n\nOur GitHub project's roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're at, and when we expect to bring them to you:\n\n- [Material-UI community](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/projects/25)\n- [Material-UI X](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui-x/projects/1)\n\n## New components\n\nHere are the components we will work on being supported in the Material-UI ecosystem, no matter if they are part of the [community edition](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) (MIT license) or [Material-UI X](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui-x), a paid extension for enterprises:\n\n- \ud83e\uddea Close to becoming stable, already released as unstable\n- \ud83d\udee0 Work in progress, will be or already released as unstable\n- \u23f3 Planning to build\n- \u2b50\ufe0f We will make some of the features available in [Material-UI X](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui-x) (parts won't be MIT)\n\n| Name                                                                              | Status |\n| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |\n| Timeline                                                                          | \ud83e\uddea     |\n| Tree View                                                                         | \ud83e\uddea     |\n| Tree View - Multiselect                                                           | \ud83e\uddea     |\n| Data Grid                                                                         | \ud83e\uddea     |\n| [Data Grid (Advanced)](/components/data-grid/getting-started/#feature-comparison) | \ud83e\uddea\u2b50   |\n| Date Picker                                                                       | \ud83e\uddea     |\n| Date Range Picker                                                                 | \ud83e\uddea\u2b50   |\n| Advanced layout                                                                   | \u23f3\u2b50\ufe0f  |\n| Carousel                                                                          | \u23f3     |\n| Charts                                                                            | \u23f3\u2b50\ufe0f  |\n| Dropdown                                                                          | \u23f3     |\n| Dropzone                                                                          | \u23f3     |\n| File Upload                                                                       | \u23f3     |\n| Gantt Chart                                                                       | \u23f3\u2b50\ufe0f  |\n| Gauge                                                                             | \u23f3\u2b50\ufe0f  |\n| Image                                                                             | \u23f3     |\n| Masonry                                                                           | \u23f3     |\n| Navbar                                                                            | \u23f3     |\n| NProgress                                                                         | \u23f3     |\n| Nested Menu                                                                       | \u23f3     |\n| Numeric Input                                                                     | \u23f3     |\n| Rich Text Editor                                                                  | \u23f3\u2b50\ufe0f  |\n| Scheduler                                                                         | \u23f3\u2b50\ufe0f  |\n| Scrollspy                                                                         | \u23f3     |\n| Sparkline                                                                         | \u23f3\u2b50\ufe0f  |\n| Window Splitter                                                                   | \u23f3\u2b50\ufe0f  |\n| Tree Select                                                                       | \u23f3\u2b50\ufe0f  |\n| Tree View - Checkbox                                                              | \u23f3\u2b50\ufe0f  |\n| Tree View - Drag & Drop                                                           | \u23f3\u2b50\ufe0f  |\n| Tree View - Virtualization                                                        | \u23f3\u2b50\ufe0f  |\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f **Disclaimer**: We operate in a dynamic environment, and things are subject to change.
